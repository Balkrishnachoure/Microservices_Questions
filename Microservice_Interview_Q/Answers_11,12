11. How do you perform logging and monitoring in a microservices architecture using Spring Boot?
   Follow-up: Can you explain how tools like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack or Prometheus/Grafana 
   are used for monitoring and observability?
Ans.In Spring Boot, you can perform logging and monitoring in various ways:

1.Centralized Logging:
Logback and SLF4J: Spring Boot uses SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) and Logback as the default logging mechanism. You can customize log levels and format via application.properties or logback.xml.

Log Aggregation: Since microservices generate logs in separate instances, you need centralized logging to gather and analyze them efficiently.

2.Spring Boot Actuator:
Actuator exposes production-ready endpoints to monitor and manage Spring Boot applications. It provides health checks, metrics, and other operational information.

Common Actuator endpoints include /health, /metrics, /info, and /env.

You can integrate the actuator with external monitoring systems like Prometheus, ELK, or others.

3.Distributed Tracing:

In a microservices setup, requests often traverse multiple services. Distributed tracing helps track how requests propagate through the services.

Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin are commonly used for adding trace IDs and span IDs to logs. This allows correlating logs across different microservices.

## ELK Stack for Centralized Logging : 
--------
The ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) is a powerful tool for logging and monitoring:

1.Elasticsearch:
A distributed search and analytics engine where logs and metrics are stored. It allows for fast querying of large volumes of logs.

2.Logstash:
A pipeline tool used to collect, parse, and ship log data to Elasticsearch. It can process logs from various services, filter or transform the data, and forward them to Elasticsearch.

3.Kibana:
A visualization layer on top of Elasticsearch that allows for creating dashboards, searching through logs, and setting up alerts.
Kibana makes it easy to monitor system health by visualizing logs from multiple microservices in one place.

4.Flow:
Spring Boot applications send logs to Logstash, which processes them and sends them to Elasticsearch.
Kibana reads from Elasticsearch and visualizes the logs and metrics in an interactive dashboard.
--------------------
## Prometheus and Grafana for Metrics Monitoring :
 # Prometheus:
A time-series database designed for real-time metrics collection. It scrapes metrics from services (e.g., using Spring Boot Actuator) at regular intervals and stores them.

Spring Boot integrates with Prometheus via Micrometer. This integration exposes application metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format (/actuator/prometheus endpoint).

 # Grafana:
A visualization and dashboard tool that reads from Prometheus (and other data sources) to create graphs and dashboards.
You can set up Grafana to visualize metrics such as CPU usage, memory, service response times, request rates, etc.
Alerts can be configured in Grafana to notify operators of issues such as high latency or low availability.

 # Flow:
Spring Boot applications expose metrics using the Actuator endpoints, which Prometheus scrapes.

Prometheus stores the data and Grafana pulls the metrics from Prometheus to visualize and monitor them in real-time dashboards .
