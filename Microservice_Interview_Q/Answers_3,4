Ans 3 : 
Service discovery in microservices allows services to find and communicate with each other without hardcoding network locations (like IP addresses or URLs). 
This is crucial in dynamic environments where instances of services may scale up or down, move between hosts, or change their network addresses.
Service discovery automates the process of locating services, enabling dynamic routing and scaling.

How Service Discovery Works :
1.Service Registration: Each service registers itself with a Service Registry, providing its network address (IP/hostname and port).
2.Service Discovery: When one service needs to communicate with another, it queries the service registry to find the location of the target service.
3.Health Monitoring: The registry monitors the health of services. Unhealthy instances are removed from the registry to ensure that only available services are discoverable.


Spring Cloud provides easy integration for service discovery via various tools like Eureka, Zookeeper, and Consul .

1. Add dependencies in pom.xml : 

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
</dependency>

2.Enable Eureka Client by adding @EnableEurekaClient to your main application class.

3.In application.properties or application.yml, configure the Eureka server location:  

     eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka/

Ans 4 : There are several strategies to manage configuration, especially when dealing with microservices that are deployed 
independently but need to share certain configurations (like database credentials, API URLs, etc.)

1. Local Configuration with application.properties or application.yml:
 -> Each microservice can have its own application.properties or application.yml file that defines its configuration.
 -> This is the simplest approach but can become cumbersome when managing many microservices, as configuration is scattered and duplicated across services.

2. Profiles for Environment-Specific Configurations:
 -> Spring Boot allows setting different profiles for different environments (e.g., dev, test, prod) with separate configuration 
  files like application-dev.yml, application-prod.yml.
 -> You can switch between profiles using the "spring.profiles.active" property, but this still requires managing configurations in each service individually.

3.Environment Variables and Command-Line Arguments:
 -> You can override configuration values using environment variables or by passing arguments at runtime. This is often used in containerized 
   environments (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to inject configuration dynamically.

4. Centralized Configuration with Spring Cloud Config:
 -> Spring Cloud Config provides a centralized configuration server that serves the configuration for all microservices 
    from a single source, such as a Git repository.
 -> Microservices fetch their configuration from this centralized server at startup or refresh 
    their configuration at runtime.
 -> This helps to externalize and centralize configuration management, simplifying updates and avoiding 
    duplication.

### What is Spring Cloud Config, and how does it help with centralized configuration?

Ans : It consists of two main components:

1.Config Server:
-> A standalone Spring Boot application that serves as a central place to manage external 
   configurations for microservices.
-> It retrieves configuration properties from external sources, usually a Git repository 
   (but also other backends like file systems, HashiCorp Vault, or databases).
-> Microservices fetch their configurations from the Config Server, either at startup or on-demand, 
   reducing the need to store configuration locally.

2.Config Client:
 ->Microservices act as config clients, fetching their configurations from the central config server.
 ->You can easily enable this by including spring-cloud-config-client in your microservices' dependencies.
 ->The @RefreshScope annotation can be used in Spring Boot applications to refresh configuration properties 
   without restarting the application, supporting dynamic reloading of configuration. 

## Code Setup : 

Step 1: Set Up the Spring Cloud Config Server :

1.Add Dependencies in pom.xml :
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-config-server</artifactId>
</dependency>

2. Enable Config Server in the Main Application :

 @SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigServer
public class ConfigServerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ConfigServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}

3.Configure the Config Server (application.yml)

   server:
  port: 8888  # Config server will run on this port

spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/your-username/config-repo  # Replace with your repo URL
          clone-on-start: true


4.Create a Git Repository for Configuration Files

config-repo/
├── microservice-1.yml
├── microservice-2.yml
└── application.yml

5. Run the Config Server :
->  You can verify that the server is working by accessing:
        Common config: http://localhost:8888/application/default .
        Service-specific config: http://localhost:8888/microservice-1/default .

------------------
STEP 2 : Set Up the Config Client (Microservice) :

1. Add Dependencies in pom.xml :

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId>
</dependency>

2. Configure Each Microservice (bootstrap.yml) : 
 ->Each microservice needs to know where the Config Server is. In the bootstrap.yml file of each microservice, add:

spring:
  application:
    name: microservice-1  # Replace with your microservice name
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: http://localhost:8888  # The URL of the Config Server
      fail-fast: true  # Fail the service fast if config server is not available

 -> The spring.application.name should match the configuration file stored in the Git repo (e.g., microservice-1.yml for microservice-1).

3. Use Configuration Properties : You can now use configuration properties from the Git repository within your microservice using @Value or @ConfigurationProperties annotations.


@RestController
public class GreetingController {
  
    @Value("${greeting.message}")  // Example greeting.message present in git file 
    private String message;
  
    @GetMapping("/greet")
    public String greet() {
        return message;
    }
}

4. Enabling Dynamic Configuration Refresh : Add @RefreshScope in Microservices

@RestController
@RefreshScope
public class GreetingController {
  
    @Value("${greeting.message}")
    private String message;
  
    @GetMapping("/greet")
    public String greet() {
        return message;
    }
}
