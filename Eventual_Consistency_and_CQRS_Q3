Q.Can you explain the concepts of eventual consistency and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)? 
   How do these concepts apply to microservices databases?

Solution : 

Eventual Consistency : It is a consistency model used in  distributed computing and distributed Databases .Means when you 
         make changes to the peice of data in distributed system , that changes will not reflect immediately in all copies of 
         data accross the system .Instead ,the system guarentees that given enough time and no further updates ,all the 
         copies will eventually be consistent .

Command Query Responsibilty Segregation(CQRS) :  It is the Design Pattern in which system have seperate model for reading 
              data and writing the data .
In CQRS architectutre , Command represent actions that change the system state( creating the record , updating the data) 
            ,while query represent the requests for data retrival .
Eg : A microservice responsible for handling the user profile updates might have different data modle for writing
    (Commands) than the one used for reading the user profiles(Queries) .
This address the challenge of scalability , performance and consistency .
